This looks like a job for me
first create a repositary in github
them to move into local that is vs code
type git clone and copy the url and run
then repositary will move to vs code
then cd githubemc1
// git pull will insert all the changes made in git hub
//but for changes made in vs code
first make the cahnges then file---> save/auto save
type git add "file name"
type git commit -m "comments" (impt maintain the spaces)
type git push origin main
// origin is the code line or url that we copy during cloning
// main is the subfolder in gituhub that has the files
